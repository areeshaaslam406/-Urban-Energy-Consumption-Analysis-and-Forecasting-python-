# Urban Energy Consumption Analysis and Forecasting (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
Urban centers face increasing energy demands due to **population growth, industrialization, and climate variations**. This project aims to **analyze**, **visualize**, and **forecast** urban energy consumption patterns using historical datasets.  
By applying **time series analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models**, we aim to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and make accurate future consumption predictions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze **historical energy consumption data** for urban areas.
- Integrate **weather and pricing data** to understand influencing factors.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends.
- Engineer **time-based and rolling statistical features** for better forecasting.
- Build and evaluate **forecasting models** to predict energy consumption.
- Provide **visual insights** for decision-makers and policymakers.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The project uses two main datasets (sourced from Kaggle):
1. **Hourly Energy Consumption Data**  
   - Contains hourly energy usage records for multiple city districts.
   - Time range: Several years of historical data.

2. **Weather & Pricing Data**  
   - Includes temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors.
   - Includes energy market price data (if available).

If you upload this as `README.md` in your GitHub repo, it will automatically display on the main page and make the repo look **professional and attractive**.  

If you want, I can also **add dataset download links, sample graphs, and images** inside the README to make it visually engaging. That would make it even more impressive to visitors.
